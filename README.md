# PDF and Webpage Information and Inference App

Welcome to the PDF and Webpage Information and Inference App! This application allows you to upload PDF files or enter URLs of webpages, process their content, and perform retrieval-augmented generation for information extraction and Q&A. Built with Streamlit and LlamaIndex, it leverages HuggingFace models for embedding and inference.

## Features

- **Upload PDFs:** Upload and process PDF files for content analysis.
- **Webpage Processing:** Enter URLs to ingest and analyze webpage content.
- **Vector Store Creation:** Create and persist vector stores for efficient retrieval.
- **Query Interface:** Ask questions about the processed content and get accurate answers.
- **Interactive Chat:** Engage in a chat interface for querying the content.
- **Persistent Storage:** Save and load vector stores for re-use.
